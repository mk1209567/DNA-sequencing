# DNA-sequencing

In this repositroy, I used different method to solve different DNA sequencing problems.
- Edit distance and assembly problem: This script includes the method to compute the edit distance (insertion, deletion, and substitution) between two DNA sequences. It also contains the method to assemble multiple DNA reads into one sequence based on their overlaps
- Query DNA sub-sequence: querying a DNA read in a reference genome and allowing mismatches.
- Sequence assembly: assembling multiple DNA reads into one sequence based on their overlaps with faster solution.
